This is the notes for HeapSort

One of the applications of the heap data structure is to 
sort data.

so lets say we have a interger array with a bunch of random numbers

we can use the heap class to sort the array
so we create a heap object
we are going to loop over the array and add each number in the array

now that we finished looping the values in the array 
we need to note something here

This heap that we currently have is a maxheap so the root node holds the 
largest value which is 10
if we remove 10 the next greatest value will be 5

this means that if we keep removing these numbers from the heap they are going to come out in descending order

lets try it out!
so while the heap is not empty we are going to console log the removed items from the heap

now instead of a while loop we can use a for loop and modify the element in the array

so we create a basic for loop
we are going to stop it when i is greater than numbers.length and 
increment the i

in each iteration set numbers[i] (this reads numbers of i) = heap.remove()

now the array is sorted in descending order 
lets console it out 

now lets try to make it in ascending order 

this is one of the applications of heaps
