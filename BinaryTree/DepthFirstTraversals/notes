This is the notes for DepthFirstTraversals

We are going to learn how to implement tree traversal algorithms 
using recursion

we are going to do the preOrder traversal on the example tree
(check for screenshot )

Now here is something interesting the left and right nodes are subtrees
so when we get to the leftnode we forget about all the other nodes in this 
tree we imagine that this subtree is the only tree in the work that we want to 
traverse once again we start at the root then go to the left then right 

here we have a small subtree with only 3 nodes or two levels but this sub tree could be
very large so when ever we go to the left we have to focus on that subtree
so we are breaking down this large complex problem into smaller and easier to solve problems 

this is where we are going to use recursion 
we need to create a new method this method should have a parameter and that parameter should be the root of the 
tree to traverse when we want to visit the left or right nodes we are going to
recursively call that method 

so in the tree class we are going to make a new method called traversePreOder
this method takes a value parameter root

in this method we need to visit the root and print the value on the console 
then we are going to visit the left and right children
