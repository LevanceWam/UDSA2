Another popular interview question is printing the nodes at a given distance from the root
for example they give us a tree like we ahve a screen shot of and 
say write code to print print all of the nodes with distance three from the root 

so for this example we are going to start from the root and we go 3 levels down and print these 2 nodes
3 and 8  

how are we going to solve this problem? 
with trees we should always think about recursion we 
need to think about breaking this problem down into smaller problems 

now what is the easiest case?
that is when the distance equals 0 
simply print the value of the root node 

so we can start the root node with the number we want to travel and 
everytime we go down a level we subtract from that number till we hit 0 

so this recursive method needs to take 2 parameters one is the root of the tree and 
the other its distance parmeter we're going to use this method to traverse the tree
everytime we go down we decrement the number by 1 
when the distance is zero all we are going to do is print the value of the root node 

solution:
just like the other methods
