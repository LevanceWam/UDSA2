This is the notes for LevelOrderTraversal

Earlier we mentioned that there are 2 catergories of algoritms to traverse our trees
breadth first and depth first 

so far we hav been working with depth now we can look into breadth also known 
as level order traversal 

in level order traversal we go level by level we start from the top we print 20
then we go to the second level and we print 10 and 30 and so on

so how do we implement this? 
well first we need to find how many levels do we have this is equal to the height of our tree
every node has a height property 

the leaf nodes at the bottom start at 0 and as we go up the tree the number increases
the height pf the tree equals the height of the root
