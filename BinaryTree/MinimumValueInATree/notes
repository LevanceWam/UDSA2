This is the notes for MinimumValueInATree

In this lecture we are going to find the minimum value in a binary tree
we are going to use recursion in this lecture also 
as we need to pratice taking big problems and breaking them down into 
smaller easier problems 

to find the minimum value from a tree we need to find the minimum
value in the left and right subtree and then compare the 2 values 
with the value of the root 

when we look at the right subtree we see that it will be super easy to find the 
minimum value because there are not that many nodes to deal with 

for example looking at the right subtree we have to compare 4 to 30 
4 is less than 30 so we get 4 back here

Now what kind of traversal algorithm we use here to accomplish this?
we used the PostOrder traversal we start at the leaf nodes up to the 
root to find the minimum value

so lets code this part out 
we are going to start with a private method
