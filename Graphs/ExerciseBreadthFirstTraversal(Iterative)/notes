This is the notes for ExerciseBreadthFirstTraversal(Iterative)

implementing the breadth first algorithm is very similar to the depth first traversal 
algorithm execept instead of using a stack we use a queue

everything else is exactly the same
here is why (please look at the screenshot)
we are going to start at the A node as the root 
so we have a queue 
F [] B
F is the front and B is the back
so we add A to the queue and then we give it to the while loop
in our while loop we remove the item in the front of the queue and visit it
so we are going to print A and then look at it's unvisited neighbors

so we then add the b and the c to the queue in the next iteration we are going to remove the item at the front 
which means we are going to remove B visit and print it 

now we look at its unvisited neighbors and we add it to the end of the queue
we are then going to remove the C then followed by the D
