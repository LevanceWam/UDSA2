This is the notes for ExerciseDepthFirstTraversal(Recursive)

we are going to implement the depth-first traversal of on the following 
graph(screenshot in folder) the implementation
is vert similar to what we had to do in the binary tree section

because remember a tree is a special kind of graph

so what we are going to need is a recursive method that takes a node obj 
visit that node and all of its neighbors recursively 

we want to make sure that we don't visit the same node twice 
beacuse in graphs it is possible to get the same node from a different 
different paths 

this didn't happen in trees so we didn't have to worry about this before 
so we have to handle this scenario

the best ideal data structure to handle this would be to use a set
because we are only dealing with the keys/values 
it allows us to look up an item in constant time and only stores the keys not the values
and it won't save the same key twice
