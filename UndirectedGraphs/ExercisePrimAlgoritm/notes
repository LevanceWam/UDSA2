this is the notes for ExercisePrimAlgoritm

We are now going to take a look at prims algorithm 
which is one of the popular algorithms for finding
the  minimum spanning tree of a graph

we start off by selecting a mode it can be any node in the graph
so we are going to start at A now we look at its edges 
and pick the on with the minimum weight 

A has 2 edges the edge with the minimum weight is the one from A to C 
so we add this edge and it's target node to our tree 
Then we go to C now our tree has 2 nodes A and C 

Now we should extend this tree ans add another node but which node should we go for 
we have to look at all of the edges connected to the exisiting nodes
and pick the one with the minimum weight 

we have between A,B C,B and C,D 
we are not considering the B, D edge because it is not connected to the nodes of our tree 
at each step we want to maintain a tree we want to make sure all nodes are connected so out of all these edges 
the smallest is from C to B 

so we add the edge and the target node to our tree
again we have to look at the edges connected  to all the nodes of our tree
we have 3 edges to pick from 

the smallest is from B to A but we alreadt visited A so w are not interested in this 
so the next smallest is B to D 

we have not visited D yet so lets add this edge and target node to the tree
Now we visited all of the nodes and we have a minimum spanning tree 

so the idea of prims algorithm  is to extend the tree by adding the smallest connected edge. this is another example of a
greedy algorithm

Okay lets talk about implementation;
at each step we want to pick the edge with the minimum weight out of the edges connected to the exisiting nodes 
How do we accomplish this?

well everytime we visit a node we add edges to unvisited neighbors to a list or
pull up available edgs these are the edges that are connected to our tree 

now this list we want to pick the edge with the minimum weight 
what is the ideal data structure for this?
A priority Queue 

with a PQ we can pick the minimum weight edge in constant teim we are going to 
repeat this until we have added all the nodes in the graph for the spanning tree

now how are we going to represent the spanning tree we can use the weighted  graph class so
we don't have to create a new one because a tree is essentially a graph
