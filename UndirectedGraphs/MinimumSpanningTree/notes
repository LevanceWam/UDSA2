This is the notes for MinimumSpanningTree

Another topic that comes up in interviews 
is the MinimumSpanningTree of graph so lets 
say that the nodes of these graphs are our offices and
the edges represent the connection between these offices 

now to connect these offices we need to put literal cable between them 
the more cables we need the more we have to pay 
what is the best way to find the minimum cost of doing this 
it does not matter if it is directly connected or undirectly connected

so we decided to remove the connection from A to C but this is unnessarary 
because A is connected to C through b
we can aslo remove the edge from B to D 

what we have left if the tree is called a spanning tree
we have converted the graph to a tree
as we learned earlier a tree is a graph with out a cycle 

spanning tree is not unqiue we can create this tree in many ways 
so if we revert back to the old graph we can remove different edges
and all the nodes are all connected we have a spanning tree 

basically if we have end nodes in a graph 
the spanning tree should have exactly N - 1 to equal the amount of edges 

each spanning tree has a cost and that is the sum of the weight of the trees edges 
there is a algorithm that is used to find the minimum costing spanning tree we are going to 
take a look at this in the next lecture
