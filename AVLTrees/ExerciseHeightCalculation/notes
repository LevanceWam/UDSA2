This is the notes for ExerciseHeightCalculation

now that we implemented the insert method the next thing we need to do is 
calculate the height of every node 

because in avl trees we have to compare the height of the left and right sub trees of every node
and make sure that the difference is not greater than 1
this is how we detect if the tree is unbalanced

so in the AVL tree object we need to introduce a new field for 
storing the height of the node 

then when we insert a new node we should reset the height of all the parents of this new node 
so we set root.height = max(left,right)  + 1

this is how we calculated the height of the node in the binary tree

after we insert the new node as a child of the root node 
we are going to reset the height of this node and because we are calling this 
private method recursively everytime we step out of this method 
we get the parent of the current node this way we can reset all of the 
heights of all the parents of the new node 

solution:

first in the AVL node we are going to want to create a height value in the AVL node class

next we are going to create a private method for height
in this method we want to check and see if the node is null so if 
there isn't a node then we return -1 else we return the the nodes height

Now for creating the logic to add a height
in the insert method 

we are going to set the height of the root left and right child and add it by one 
thats it

To break it down further:
When we insert the new node into the tree the height of that node becomes 
0 instead of 1 because we are immediatelty returning after 
we intialize the empty tree with a node.

ex tree insert 10
root = 10 height 0

now because now have something in the tree when we insert another node into the tree 
we go to the second set of if statements that check whether the value is 
greater or less than the root value
once one of those statements fire  we go to the root height line
we get the greater number out of the left and right children and add 1 to it

ex  tree insert 20
root = 10 height 1
root = 20 height 0

because the right child was null it executed the first if statement and immediatelty returned
