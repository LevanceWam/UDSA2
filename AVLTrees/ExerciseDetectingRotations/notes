This is the notes for ExerciseDetectingRotations

The next thing we need to figure out is what kind of rotation we need 
so if we have a right skrewed tree we need to 
do a left rotation on 10 which will make it the left child of 20 

and if we have a left skewed tree we need to do a 
right rotation on 30 and make it the right child of 20

if we have it with a list like this 10 30 20 
we are going to have to do a RL rotation

As a part of detecting what kind of rotation we need we 
need to figure out what is the shape of the tree

The way we figure out the shape of a tree is by using the balance factor
if the root is a right heavy node we look at the balance factor of the right child
