this is the notes for ExerciseLookingUpAWord

for this exercise we need to create a method 
where we give it a word and it returns a boolean value 

so just like the boolean method we need to iterate over every letter in the word
and walk down the trie 

If any of the letters are missing we need to return false right away 
when we get the the last letter
in the word we are looking for we need to make sure that the letter marks the end of the word if it doesn't
we still have to mark it false 
so if we have the word canada only in the trie and we search 
can this will return false 

solution:

First I created the metod that accepts a word

next i created a variable called current and set its value to root 
making it easier for us to traverse 

created a for of loop so we can iterate through all of letters in the word that was entered

since the trie starts with an empty string we are going to check and see if 
any of it's children has the letter of the word if it doesnt we are going to 
return false immediately

we keep doing this until we hit the end of the loop

once we are done with the loop we are going to see if the current value is at a end of a word
if it is we will return false;
so if we had the word canada in the trie and we were looking for can 
current is only going to stop at can and since we didn't 
make n the isEndOfWord we are going to get false

Note we made a quick change to the trienode class to set the property isEndOfWord false 
this way we can return the false value because before we were geting undefined
