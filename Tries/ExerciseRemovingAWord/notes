This is the notes for ExerciseRemovingAWord
 
 Lets start working on the delete operation.
 so lets imagine that we have the words care and car in the trie 

lets say that we wanted to remove the word car 
we start from the root and using recursion we do a post order 
traveral in this tree so we go all the way down until we find the last node 
for the last letter of this word which in this case is 'r' in car

now in this situation we can not remove the r because otherwise we would end 
up removing the word care as well 
so to fix this we should change the isEndOfWord to false 

Now what about care?
Well same approach we would do a post traversal using recursion and 
get the last node 
then we are going to change the isEndOfWord to false
and get the chidren of this node  

since 'e' doesn't have any children we can physically remove it from the 
tree so save some space 
on the way back when we are done with the recursive calls we get back to 
the 'r' and this is where we remove the node for 'e' so when we get back to 
'r' we asked the e if it had any children since it didnt we removed it 

In this case the deletion stops here because we want to keep the word car in the try
but if we didnt have it we would continue to remove all of the nodes 

so if it has children or is apart of another word we stop the deletion
