This is the notes for Travesals

Let's talk about traversing in tries.
There are 2 ways to traverse a trie:

Pre-Order traversal
Post-Order Travesal

with pre-Order traversal we visit each node first before we
visit its children 

with post order traversal we go deep into the trie and start from the leaf 
nodes and then come back up

so lets go declare some methods and try it out 

so we are going to create a public method called traverse that is going to call on a 
private method to traverse the trie
we are going to work on the pre-order travesal first 

with pre order we need to visit the root first 
we can simply do this by printing the value on the terminal

now we need to visit each child of the root node 
here is somthing interesting to remember with tries]
unlike binary trees we do not have left and right 
children each node can have a lot of children as many as 26 so 

so we should visit each of them starting from the left 
to make this a little easier on ourselves we are going to go back into
the trienode class and add another service for us to get all of the children of a node
