<p>Welcome to the Ultimate Data Structures & Algorithms 2 Tutorial!</p>

<p>In this course we are going to be looking at Non-Linear Data Structures. That include Binary Trees, AVL Trees, Heaps, Tries, and Graphs. These data structures and algorithms are a little more complex than the ones from part one. All of the data structures from part one can be classified as linear data structures.</p>

<h2 id=section1>Binary Trees</h2>

<p>In computer science we have a lot of non-linear data structures. The most important of them are trees. Tree structures have tons of applications in the real world. Things like Databases, Websites, Graphical User Interfaces and etc. They tend to be the trickiest interview questions so this section has nice exercises that can help us work with tress better.</p>

<h3>What are trees?</h3>

<p>A tree is a data structure that stores elements in a hierarchy these element are referred to as nodes and the lines that connect them as edges. Each node contains a value or data. We can have trees full of intergers or object. We can have personal objects in a tree these objects would be a part of an organization or a family. The top node in the tree is called the root. The root has 2 children and the root is the parent of these nodes. These nodes also have 2 children each if the nodes on the bottom of of the tree these are known as leaf nodes.</p>

<p>The current tree we are referencing above the nodes have a maximum of two children. This is a special kind of tree called a Binary Tree and just like wwe have different keys in the real world we have different kinds in the world of computer science. They are fundamentally the same, but slightly different in terms of the number of children each node can have and how the values in these nodes can be arranged.</p>

<p>This section we are going to focus on Binary trees because they are easy to understand and they come up in interviews frequently. Once we learn about binary trees we will quickly learn about the other kinds of trees.</p>

<h3>Application of trees</h3>

<h3>We use trees anywhere we ant to represent hierarchical data. Such as a tree of people in our organization, family, or flies and folders on your desk. Next, we have databases database management systems use trees for indexing so they can quickly look up data. Another great application of trees is implementing auto completion. For example chrome stores all of our previous web searches in a tree so whenever we are typing a query it tries to match it with previously stored queries. They are also used in compliers, compliers use a special type of tree called syntax tree to parse expression. They are also used in compression algorithms such as those used by JPEG and MP3 file formats </h3>
