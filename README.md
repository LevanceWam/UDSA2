<p>Welcome to the Ultimate Data Structures & Algorithms 2 Tutorial!</p>

<p>In this course we are going to be looking at Non-Linear Data Structures. That include Binary Trees, AVL Trees, Heaps, Tries, and Graphs. These data structures and algorithms are a little more complex than the ones from part one. All of the data structures from part one can be classified as linear data structures.</p>

<p>In computer science we have a lot of non-linear data structures. The most important of them are trees. Tree structures have tons of applications in the real world. Things like Databases, Websites, Graphical User Interfaces and etc.</p>
