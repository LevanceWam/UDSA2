<h1 id=home>Ultimate Data Structures & Algorithms 2 Course</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Ultimate Data Structures & Algorithms 2 Tutorial!</p>

<p>In this course we are going to be looking at Non-Linear Data Structures. That include Binary Trees, AVL Trees, Heaps, Tries, and Graphs. These data structures and algorithms are a little more complex than the ones from part one.</p>
